                This platform is designed to assist students with educational needs by leveraging advanced AI capabilities tailored for academic purposes. To gain access, users must submit three graded documents, such as tests, quizzes, or homework, each scoring 95% or higher, to continue our efforts in creating a well taught LLM.
            </p>
            <h2>How to Gain Access</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>Prepare three academic documents, such as tests, quizzes, or homework. Ensure each document clearly displays:</li>
                <ul>
                    <li>Your name</li>
                    <li>The grade (95% or higher)</li>
                    <li>The date the document was graded</li>
                </ul>
                <li>Click the <strong>Upload Documents</strong> button below to submit your files via Google Drive.</li>
                <li>Once you have uploaded your documents, email us at <a href="mailto:coleli27@sssas.org">coleli27@sssas.org</a> to confirm your submission.</li>
                <li>Our team will review your documents within 48 hours. If approved, you will receive an access link to the AI Tutors platform via email.</li>
                <li>If you feel uncomfortable submitting your documents to the public folder, you may privately share them with me at <a href="mailto:coleli27@sssas.org">coleli27@sssas.org</a>, but note that a longer review time may be required.</li>
